This is a visual project made with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.<br>
VenueScanner asked for an innovate and efficient way to improve their UX/UI system.<br>
This is my suggestion: The 3 Way Layout System. All In One.

## VenueScanner - Design Challenge
1. Download Project as `.zip` <br>
2. Open `PROJECT HERE` to evaluate the final result<br>
3. Explore `Assets` with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator

## The 3 New Layout System
The user has the control of its own experience by displaying  the content of the page in:
![z_buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31135848/34262334-095b178c-e664-11e7-91db-0cc1f75a0712.png)
- List (focus on the information of the venue)
- Grid (focus on the images of the venue)
- Map (focus on the location of the venue)

Efficient Way of Sort, customisable option by:
- Most Popular;
- Most Recent;
- Highest Price;
- Lowest Price.

## Grid Images
Grid layout system allows the visual users to be surrounded with images. The focus is on the pictures. <br>
The user can:
- see the venue by its own image
- preview a small picture of the venue
- save  the venue in its own shortlist
- estimate  its own budget
- know  the highest capacity of the venue
- locate  the avenue
- click  for more information
